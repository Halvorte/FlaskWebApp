# FlaskWebApp
This is a flask webapp i am making to learn flask and containerizing using docker.

## How i built the docker imge and ran it
I built a docker image using the command "docker image build -t docker-flask-test ."
Then i ran the image using the command "docker run -p 5000:5000 -d docker-flask-test"
